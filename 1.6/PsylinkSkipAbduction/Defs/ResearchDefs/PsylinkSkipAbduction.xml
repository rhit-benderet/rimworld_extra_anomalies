        <label>psylink skip abduction</label>
        <description>A new form of skip abduction that will target psycasters over non-psycasters. Increased quality will make it more likely to target a psycaster as well as decrease the coma time. The increased psychic interference will cause the abducted pawn to have a longer coma and higher recruitment resistance.</description>
