						<AnomalyLabel>endless syringe</AnomalyLabel>
						<AnomalyDesc>A medical syringe filled with a viscous black liquid. \n\nThe liquid regenerates after being expelled.\n\nClassified as Class-0 (Safe) anomaly.</AnomalyDesc>

						<label>#1/4 Anomalous syringe study report</label>
						<text>Properties of the Syringe's liquid\n\nSubject: {PAWN_nameDef}\n\nAbstract:\nThe Anomalous Syringe appears to be capable of producing the viscous black liquid contained within it. After a couple minutes outside the syringe, the liquid appears to vanish. When mixed with human blood, the liquid takes significantly longer to dissipate, perhaps injecting it into a human could lead to fruitful results.\n\nObservations:\nSubject was presented with the anomalous syringe. With considerable effort {PAWN_nameDef} was able to eject the liquid from the syringe.\nSubject then pulled back on the syringe and liquid reappeared in the syringe.\n{PAWN_nameDef} observed that the liquid vanished after 4 minutes outside the syringe, however upon mixing it with fresh blood it stayed for a couple hours.\n\nDiscussion:\nThe Anomalous Syringe has been classified as Class-0 (Safe) anomaly.\n\nRecommendations:\nInjection of the syringe into a human is necessary in order to determine how it reacts to the body.</text>

						<text>Injection of the virus\n\nSubject: {PAWN_nameDef}\n\nAbstract:\nUpon injection the subject was rapidly cured of all previous infections. The virus has shown an ability to mutate itself and to cause decay in the body. It is recommended to proceed with caution.\n\nObservations:\nSubject was told to inject themselves with the syringe. {PAWN_nameDef}, who had been suffering with a particularly nasty case of the plague, felt better almost within minutes.\nUpon testing the subjects blood, no traces of the plague were found at all. It had been entirely eradicated. However, worryingly it was noticed that certain blood cells had also mutated by the virus. The virus also seems to slowly mutate, gaining a new ability every few days.\n\nDiscussion:\nThe Anomalous Syringe has been reclassified as Class-1 (Caution) anomaly.\n\nRecommendations:\nFurther research into the potential effects of the phthoravirus. It may be possible to harness the phthoravirus but it is suspected that it is not as benign as it appears.</text>

						<text>Phthoravirus Stages\n\nAnalysis of the effects of the phthoravirus have discovered the course of action the virus will take.\n\nStage 1+ (Purging): The virus acts as a secondary, hyperactive immune system. It will purge the host body of all diseases very quickly.\nStage 2+ (Repairing): The virus turbocharges mitosis in the host body leading to quicker injury recovery times.\nStage 3+ (Hardening): The virus forms an shell of bioferrite between the layers of skin in the host's body. The shell appears to have the approximate effectiveness of flak.\nStage 4+ (Nullifying): The virus blocks the host's pain recepters rendering them incapable of feeling pain.\nStage 5+ (Transforming): The virus starts generating its own replacement cells, able to heal any injury or missing parts.\nStage 6 (Transformation): The virus has created enough replacement cells to transform the host into an anomalous creature. The process is irreversible.</text>

						<text>Research into the phthoravirus has revealed that a modified strain of influenza may be able to fight back against the virus, delaying the next mutation.\nThis strain of influenza will have more detrimental effects the further along the phthoravirus is, and it cannot reverse a mutation if has already occured nor can it fully eradicate the phthoravirus. Ensure that every infected colonist does not miss a dose.</text>

						<AnomalyLabel>ankle monitor</AnomalyLabel>
						<AnomalyDesc>An ankle monitor that discourages the person it is attached to from going outside by administering a painful electric shock. The shock becomes more severe the longer the subject is outside.</AnomalyDesc>
						<threshold>1.5</threshold>
						<label>#1/4 Strange device study report</label>
						<text>Mechanics of the strange device\n\nSubject: {PAWN_nameDef}\n\nAbstract:\nThe device appears to be an ankle monitor of sorts. There is a display that acts as a countdown, likely to the release of the ankle monitor. Exiting an indoors environment will cause the ankle montior to deliver an electric shock. The severity will increase the longer the subject has stayed outside, eventually culminating in death. It has a nasty habit of randomly latching onto pawns.\n\nObservations:\nUpon studying the device, it latched onto {PAWN_nameDef}'s ankle. After the incident, the subject seemed unwilling to exit the facility, complaining of a sharp electric shock when going outside. Eventually they were forced to leave the facility only to be rushed back in a couple minutes later after they had been knocked unconscious by the device. There appears to be no way to remove it until the timer is complete after which it will likely fall off on its own.\n\nDiscussion:\nThe ankle monitor has been classified as Class-2 (Warning) anomaly.\n\nRecommendations:\nFurther research into the monitor once it detatches from {PAWN_nameDef}.</text>
